The PYME Storage and compute cluster architecture
*************************************************

The PYME cluster architecture facilitates parallelized data analysis and
distributed data storage. It can be deployed in a modular approach, just for
parallel (distributed) analysis, or just for distributed data storage, and can
be used on a single computer using internal ports, or on its own network
interface to facilitate the use of multiple computers.
